# Kynay Project

This is **Kynay OS**, my personal web-based operating system.  
It simulates a Windows-style desktop environment using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
All features are packed into a single file — `os.html` — with a size of just **34KB**.

🛠️ Built entirely on my Android phone (OPPO A12), without any frameworks or external libraries.
