# Kynay Project

This is **Kynay OS**, my personal web-based operating system.  
It simulates a Windows-style desktop environment using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
All features are packed into a single file — `os.html` — with a size of just **34KB**.

🛠️ Built entirely on my Android phone (OPPO A12), without any frameworks or external libraries.

## 🌟 Features
- Boot animation and welcome screen
- Taskbar and start menu
- Multiple draggable and resizable app windows
- Built-in apps: Notepad, Calculator, Terminal, Music Player, Browser, and more
- Smooth transitions and responsive UI
- 100% written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS
